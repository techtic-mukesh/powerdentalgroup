If a discount was provided at the time of purchase on the overall order, not including individual instrument discounts, then the overall discounted percentage will be pro-rated across any individual instrument returned within that order. Please refer to the shipping policy below for shipping guidelines. Proof of purchase is required to process the return. Returns will not be accepted without a completed return order form. Reference shipping policy accordingly.<br/><br/><strong>DISTRIBUTORS:</strong> Distributors are responsible for verifying that all instrument(s) that Power Dental provides match the details of the original invoice. The distributor has 45 days from the day the package is shipped to notify Power Dental that an instrument(s) does not match the details of the invoice provided or does not meet expectations. Only instrument(s) that are unused, left unsterilized in their original Power Dental packaging can be returned for refund/credit. Proof of purchase is required to process the return. Returns will not be accepted without a completed return order form or approved PO. Reference shipping policy accordingly.<br/><br/><strong>CLEARANCE ITEMS:</strong> No refunds, credits, or exchanges will be provided for instruments sold as “Clearance” items.

However, if you choose to use a Power Dental shipping label, a shipping charge of $15.99 (USPS Return Label) or $18.50 (FedEx Return Label) will be applied to your order or deducted from your credit/refund. Please note our return shipping labels are not insured. If you prefer to insure your package, please use your own shipping label. Lost packages must be reported within two weeks of shipment. Be sure to retain your tracking number for reference.<br/><br/>To prevent transit damage and ensure the safety of handling personnel, please securely package and cushion all contents before shipping. For added security, we recommend opting for signature-required delivery as needed.</p>"
