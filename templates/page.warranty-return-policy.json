If a discount was provided at the time of purchase on the overall order, not including individual instrument discounts, then the overall discounted percentage will be pro-rated across any individual instrument returned within that order. Please refer to the shipping policy below for shipping guidelines. Proof of purchase is required to process the return. Returns will not be accepted without a completed return order form. Reference shipping policy accordingly.</p><p><strong>DISTRIBUTORS:</strong> Distributors are responsible for verifying that all instrument(s) that Power Dental provides match the details of the original invoice. The distributor has 45 days from the day the package is shipped to notify Power Dental that an instrument(s) does not match the details of the invoice provided or does not meet expectations. Only instrument(s) that are unused, left unsterilized in their original Power Dental packaging can be returned for refund/credit. Proof of purchase is required to process the return. Returns will not be accepted without a completed return order form or approved PO. Reference shipping policy accordingly.</p><p><strong>CLEARANCE ITEMS:</strong> No refunds, credits, or exchanges will be provided for instruments sold as “Clearance” items.

This fee is subject to increase.</p><p><strong>PRIVATE LABELS/CUSTOM INSTRUMENTS:</strong> No refunds, credits, or exchanges will be provided for items with private labeling/engraving unless the private label was mis-engraved from the approved design that both parties, Power Dental and the customer, agreed upon.

Power Dental return labels are not insured; customers wishing to insure their shipment must use their own carrier and shipping label. Lost packages must be reported within two weeks of shipment, and customers are responsible for retaining tracking information. </p><p>To prevent transit damage and ensure the safety of handling personnel, all contents must be securely packaged and properly cushioned.

Should any breakage, discoloration, or malfunction occur due to proper and intended use during this period, you can rely on our commitment to facilitate hassle-free repairs or replacements at reduced costs or no extra charge.</p><p>Rest assured, each instrument seeking warranty undergoes a case-by-case inspection within our internal processes to determine applicability. If PDG requests a direct inspection of the item(s), please reference to our shipping policy accordingly. Please understand the warranty does not cover normal wear and tear or instances where instruments are used beyond their intended lifespan or limitations. This extends to instruments being utilized in ways contrary to their design and purpose. Any evidence of user negligence, improper maintenance, misuse, abuse, modifications, or alterations to the instrument will result in the warranty being void.</p><p>PDG also disclaims liability under this warranty or otherwise for damages arising from the use of commercial/residential grade washers, cleaning solutions containing chemicals not conducive to our instruments, dental automated washer-disinfectors without adhering to the manufacturer’s processing guidelines, or improper set-up and installation of the device.</p><p>As part of our commitment to continuous improvement of product quality and performance, PDG reserves the right to modify instrument designs or cease production of specific products without prior notification.
